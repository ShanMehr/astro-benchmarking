      "summary": " A fully differential calculation in perturbative quantum chromodynamics is\npresented for the production of massive photon pairs at hadron colliders. All\nnext-to-leading order perturbative contributions from quark-antiquark,\ngluon-(anti)quark, and gluon-gluon subprocesses are included, as well as\nall-orders resummation of initial-state gluon radiation valid at\nnext-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy. The regions of phase space is\nspecified in which the calculation is most reliable. Good agreement is\ndemonstrated with data from the Fermilab Tevatron, and predictions are made for\nmore detailed tests with CDF and DO data. Predictions are shown for\ndistributions of various diphoton pairs produced at the energy of the Large Hadron\nCollider (LHC). Distributions of the diphoton pairs from the decay of a Higgs\nboson are contrasted with those produced from QCD processes at the LHC, showing\nthat enhanced sensitivity to the signal can be obtained with judicious\nselection of events.\n",

      "summary": " The formation of quasi-2D spin-wave waveforms in longitudinally magnetized\nstripes of ferrimagnetic film was observed by using time- and space-resolved\nBrillouin light scattering technique. In the linear regime it was found that\nthe confinement decreases the amplitude of dynamic magnetization near the\nlateral stripe edges. Thus, the so-called effective dipolar pinning of dynamic\nmagnetization takes place at the edges.\n In the nonlinear regime a new stable spin wave packet propagating along a\nwaveguide structure, for which both transversal instability and interaction\nwith the side walls of the waveguide are important was observed. The\nexperiments and a numerical simulation of the pulse evolution show that the\nshape of the formed waveforms and their behavior are strongly influenced by the\nconfinement.\n",

An example is given for a\nthree-dimensional uniform gas. Two definitions of Cooper pair wave function are\nexamined. One of which is chosen to reflect the off-diagonal long range order\n(ODLRO). Another one corresponds to a pair projection of a BCS state. On the\nside with negative scattering length, we found that paired atoms described by\nODLRO are more bosonic than the pair projected definition.

In particular, this approach has been followed in a symmetric\nsector of loop quantum gravity known as loop quantum cosmology. Here we explore\ndifferent aspects of the relation between the ordinary Schroedinger theory and\nthe polymer description. The paper has two parts. In the first one, we derive\nthe polymer quantum mechanics starting from the ordinary Schroedinger theory\nand show that the polymer description arises as an appropriate limit. In the\nsecond part we consider the continuum limit of this theory, namely, the reverse\nprocess in which one starts from the discrete theory and tries to recover back\nthe ordinary Schroedinger quantum mechanics. We consider several examples of\ninterest, including the harmonic oscillator, the free particle and a simple\ncosmological model.\n",

Numerical methods were devised to calculate\nresponse to shock and ramp compression, and ramp decompression, generalizing\nprevious solutions for scalar equations of state. The numerical methods were\nfound to be flexible and robust, and matched analytic results to a high\naccuracy. The basic ramp and shock solution methods were coupled to solve for\ncomposite deformation paths, such as shock-induced impacts, and shock\ninteractions with a planar interface between different materials. These\ncalculations capture much of the physics of typical material dynamics\nexperiments, without requiring spatially-resolving simulations.

      "summary": " Results from spectroscopic observations of the Intermediate Polar (IP) EX Hya\nin quiescence during 1991 and 2001 are presented. Spin-modulated radial\nvelocities consistent with an outer disc origin were detected for the first\ntime in an IP. The spin pulsation was modulated with velocities near ~500-600\nkm/s. These velocities are consistent with those of material circulating at the\nouter edge of the accretion disc, suggesting corotation of the accretion\ncurtain with material near the Roche lobe radius. Furthermore, spin Doppler\ntomograms have revealed evidence of the accretion curtain emission extending\nfrom velocities of ~500 km/s to ~1000 km/s. These findings have confirmed the\ntheoretical model predictions of King & Wynn (1999), Belle et al. (2002) and\nNorton et al. (2004) for EX Hya, which predict large accretion curtains that\nextend to a distance close to the Roche lobe radius in this system. Evidence\nfor overflow stream of material falling onto the magnetosphere was observed,\nconfirming the result of Belle et al. (2005) that disc overflow in EX Hya is\npresent during quiescence as well as outburst. It appears that the hbeta and\nhgamma spin radial velocities originated from the rotation of the funnel at the\nouter disc edge, while those of halpha were produced due to the flow of\nmaterial along the field lines far from the white dwarf (narrow component) and\nclose to the white dwarf (broad-base component), in agreement with the\naccretion curtain model.\n",

The relative importance of the linear term\ndecreases with increasing size, hence convergence of DDA for large enough\nscatterers is quadratic in the common range of d. Extensive numerical\nsimulations were carried out for a wide range of d. Finally we discuss a number\nof new developments in DDA and their consequences for convergence.\n",

The energy injected at the outer scale scale has to be converted\ninto heat, which ultimately cannot be done without collisions. A KINETIC\nCASCADE develops that brings the energy to collisional scales both in space and\nvelocity. Its nature depends on the physics of plasma fluctuations. In each of\nthe physically distinct scale ranges, the kinetic problem is systematically\nreduced to a more tractable set of equations. In the \"inertial range\" above the\nion gyroscale, the kinetic cascade splits into a cascade of Alfvenic\nfluctuations, which are governed by the RMHD equations at both the collisional\nand collisionless scales, and a passive cascade of compressive fluctuations,\nwhich obey a linear kinetic equation along the moving field lines associated\nwith the Alfvenic component. In the \"dissipation range\" between the ion and\nelectron gyroscales, there are again two cascades: the kinetic-Alfven-wave\n(KAW) cascade governed by two fluid-like Electron RMHD equations and a passive\nphase-space cascade of ion entropy fluctuations. The latter cascade brings the\nenergy of the inertial-range fluctuations that was damped by collisionless\nwave-particle interaction at the ion gyroscale to collisional scales in the\nphase space and leads to ion heating. The KAW energy is similarly damped at the\nelectron gyroscale and converted into electron heat. Kolmogorov-style scaling\nrelations are derived for these cascades. Astrophysical and space-physical\napplications are discussed in detail.\n",

We use the Whitham averaging\nmethod, using a recent development of this theory for perturbed integrable\nequations. This general approach enables us not only to improve known results\non the adiabatic evolution of isolated solitary waves and periodic wave trains\nin the presence of variable topography and bottom friction, modeled by the\nChezy law, but also importantly, to study the effects of these factors on the\npropagation of undular bores, which are essentially unsteady in the system\nunder consideration. In particular, it is shown that the combined action of\nvariable topography and bottom friction generally imposes certain global\nrestrictions on the undular bore propagation so that the evolution of the\nleading solitary wave can be substantially different from that of an isolated\nsolitary wave with the same initial amplitude. This non-local effect is due to\nnonlinear wave interactions within the undular bore and can lead to an\nadditional solitary wave amplitude growth, which cannot be predicted in the\nframework of the traditional adiabatic approach to the propagation of solitary\nwaves in slowly varying media.\n",

      "summary": "  In a quantum mechanical model, Diosi, Feldmann and Kosloff arrived at a\nconjecture stating that the limit of the entropy of certain mixtures is the\nrelative entropy as system size goes to infinity. The conjecture is proven in\nthis paper for density matrices. The first proof is analytic and uses the\nquantum law of large numbers. The second one clarifies the relation to channel\ncapacity per unit cost for classical-quantum channels. Both proofs lead to\ngeneralization of the conjecture.\n",

This article describes an\nintelligent acoustic emission source locator. The intelligent locator comprises\na sensor antenna and a general regression neural network, which solves the\nlocation problem based on learning from examples. Locator performance was\ntested on different test specimens. Tests have shown that the accuracy of\nlocation depends on sound velocity and attenuation in the specimen, the\ndimensions of the tested area, and the properties of stored data. The location\naccuracy achieved by the intelligent locator is comparable to that obtained by\nthe conventional triangulation method, while the applicability of the\nintelligent locator is more general since analysis of sonic ray paths is\navoided. This is a promising method for non-destructive testing of aircraft\nframe structures by the acoustic emission method.\n",

We introduce and investigate globally (or\nintrinsically, free from local coordinates) many of the most important and most\ncommonly used special Finsler manifolds: locally Minkowskian, Berwald,\nLandesberg, general Landesberg, $P$-reducible, $C$-reducible,\nsemi-$C$-reducible, quasi-$C$-reducible, $P^{*}$-Finsler, $C^{h}$-recurrent,\n$C^{v}$-recurrent, $C^{0}$-recurrent, $S^{v}$-recurrent, $S^{v}$-recurrent of\nthe second order, $C_{2}$-like, $S_{3}$-like, $S_{4}$-like, $P_{2}$-like,\n$R_{3}$-like, $P$-symmetric, $h$-isotropic, of scalar curvature, of constant\ncurvature, of $p$-scalar curvature, of $s$-$ps$-curvature. The global\ndefinitions of these special Finsler manifolds are introduced. Various\nrelationships between the different types of the considered special Finsler\nmanifolds are found. Many local results, known in the literature, are proved\nglobally and several new results are obtained. As a by-product, interesting\nidentities and properties concerning the torsion tensor fields and the\ncurvature tensor fields are deduced. Although our investigation is entirely\nglobal, we provide; for comparison reasons, an appendix presenting a local\ncounterpart of our global approach and the local definitions of the special\nFinsler spaces considered.\n",

The bonding in the potassium-graphite compound is reasonably well\naccounted for by traditional semilocal density functional theory (DFT)\ncalculations. However, to investigate the intercalate formation energy from\npure potassium atoms and graphite requires use of a description of the graphite\ninterlayer binding and thus a consistent account of the nonlocal dispersive\ninteractions. This is included seamlessly with ordinary DFT by a van der Waals\ndensity functional (vdW-DF) approach [Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 246401 (2004)]. The\nuse of the vdW-DF is found to stabilize the graphite crystal, with crystal\nparameters in fair agreement with experiments. For graphite and\npotassium-intercalated graphite structural parameters such as binding\nseparation, layer binding energy, formation energy, and bulk modulus are\nreported. Also the adsorption and sub-surface potassium absorption energies are\nreported. The vdW-DF description, compared with the traditional semilocal\napproach, is found to weakly soften the elastic response.\n",

The system's period is short, $P=2.230736 \\pm 0.000010$ days, with\nan orbit indistinguishable from circular, $e=0.012 \\pm 0.021$. We demonstrate\ngenerally that the surface gravity of the secondary star in a single-lined\nbinary undergoing total eclipses can be derived from characteristics of the\nlight curve and spectroscopic orbit. This constrains the secondary to a unique\nline in the mass-radius diagram with $M/R^2$ = constant. For HAT-TR-205-013, we\nassume the orbit has been tidally circularized, and that the primary's rotation\nhas been synchronized and aligned with the orbital axis. Our observed line\nbroadening, $V_{\\rm rot} \\sin i_{\\rm rot} = 28.9 \\pm 1.0$ \\kms, gives a primary\nradius of $R_{\\rm A} = 1.28 \\pm 0.04$ \\rsun. Our light curve analysis leads to\nthe radius of the secondary, $R_{\\rm B} = 0.167 \\pm 0.006$ \\rsun, and the\nsemimajor axis of the orbit, $a = 7.54 \\pm 0.30 \\rsun = 0.0351 \\pm 0.0014$ AU.\nOur single-lined spectroscopic orbit and the semimajor axis then yield the\nindividual masses, $M_{\\rm B} = 0.124 \\pm 0.010$ \\msun and $M_{\\rm A} = 1.04\n\\pm 0.13$ \\msun. Our result for HAT-TR-205-013 B lies above the theoretical\nmass-radius models from the Lyon group, consistent with results from\ndouble-lined eclipsing binaries. The method we describe offers the opportunity\nto study the very low end of the stellar mass-radius relation.\n",

The latter include $k$-intersection bodies (in the\nsense of A. Koldobsky) and unit balls of finite-dimensional subspaces of\n$L_p$-spaces. In particular, we show that restrictions onto lower dimensional\nsubspaces of the spherical Radon transforms and the generalized cosine\ntransforms preserve their integral-geometric structure. We apply this result to\nthe study of sections of $\\lam$-intersection bodies. New characterizations of\nthis class of bodies are obtained and examples are given. We also review some\nknown facts and give them new proofs.\n",

Our analysis on\ntwo-state HMMs suggests that the expected maximum memory used to decode\nsequence of length $n$ with $m$-state HMM can be as low as $\\Theta(m\\log n)$,\nwithout a significant slow-down compared to the classical Viterbi algorithm.\nClassical Viterbi algorithm requires $O(mn)$ space, which is impractical for\nanalysis of long DNA sequences (such as complete human genome chromosomes) and\nfor continuous data streams. We also experimentally demonstrate the performance\nof the on-line Viterbi algorithm on a simple HMM for gene finding on both\nsimulated and real DNA sequences.\n",

A distinguished basis of such a ring is\ncomprised by analogues of the Schur functions. The corresponding structure\ncoefficients are polynomials in the parameters which we call the\nLittlewood-Richardson polynomials. We give a combinatorial rule for their\ncalculation by modifying an earlier result of B. Sagan and the author. The new\nrule provides a formula for these polynomials which is manifestly positive in\nthe sense of W. Graham. We apply this formula for the calculation of the\nproduct of equivariant Schubert classes on Grassmannians which implies a\nstability property of the structure coefficients. The first manifestly positive\nformula for such an expansion was given by A. Knutson and T. Tao by using\ncombinatorics of puzzles while the stability property was not apparent from\nthat formula. We also use the Littlewood-Richardson polynomials to describe the\nmultiplication rule in the algebra of the Casimir elements for the general\nlinear Lie algebra in the basis of the quantum immanants constructed by A.\nOkounkov and G.

As sources of these relations are employed the Heisenberg\nequations/relations for the dynamical variables and a specific condition for\nuniqueness of the operators of the dynamical variables (with respect to some\nclass of Lagrangians). The paracommutation relations or some their\ngeneralizations are pointed as the most general ones that entail the validity\nof all Heisenberg equations. The simultaneous fulfillment of the Heisenberg\nequations and the uniqueness requirement turn to be impossible. This problem is\nsolved via a redefinition of the dynamical variables, similar to the normal\nordering procedure and containing it as a special case. That implies\ncorresponding changes in the admissible commutation relations. The introduction\nof the concept of the vacuum makes narrow the class of the possible commutation\nrelations; in particular, the mentioned redefinition of the dynamical variables\nis reduced to normal ordering. As a last restriction on that class is imposed\nthe requirement for existing of an effective procedure for calculating vacuum\nmean values. The standard bilinear commutation relations are pointed as the\nonly known ones that satisfy all of the mentioned conditions and do not\ncontradict to the existing data.\n",
